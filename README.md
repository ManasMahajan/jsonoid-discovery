Schema discovery for JSON using monoids.

Currently this package uses unreleased code via GitHub Packages.
Although all the code is public, you must [create a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).
This token should be stored in a file named `.env` in the root of the repository with a line `GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`.
Only the `read:packages` permission should be required.
